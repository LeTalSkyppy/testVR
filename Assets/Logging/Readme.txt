How to use the logging scripts:

1) Attach LoggerBehavior.cs to a game object in the scene you wish to work with.
2) Tag one of the cameras in the scene to: MainCamera. This is the camera that you log.

Some variables are outcommented, as they don't work in the Pupil Labs project. If any are needed, find the scripts in _VR eye-tracking project.
